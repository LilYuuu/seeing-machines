For this assignment, I wanted to create a filter utilizing ofxCv to track faces and apply a blur effect to the tracked region.

However, I ran into an error when trying to create an `ofImage` from the tracked region. For now, I am applying the blur effect to the whole video capture. The blurred area moves along with the face tracker.

I also implemented a GUI control to freeze/restart the video capture.
